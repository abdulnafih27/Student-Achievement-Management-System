# Student Achievement Management System - Backend

This is the backend of a **Student Achievement Management System** designed to manage student projects, achievements, and academic records. The backend provides a REST API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**, with authentication using **JWT**.

## Features
- **Authentication**: Secure JWT-based user authentication.
- **Project Management**: CRUD operations for student projects.
- **Achievement Management**: CRUD operations for student achievements.
- **Marks Management**: Manage semester-wise marks.
- **Data Validation**: Data is validated using Mongoose schemas.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user, project, and achievement data.
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB to structure application data.
- **JWT**: Used for secure authentication and session management.

## Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed
- **MongoDB** installed and running

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-achievement-system-backend.git
cd student-achievement-system-backend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Environment Variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it with the following:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/achievement-system
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 4. Start the Server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend API will be running on `http://localhost:5000`.
